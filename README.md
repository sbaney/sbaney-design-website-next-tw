# sbaney-design-website-next-tw
Professional website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS

## Project Goals

The purpose of this project is mainly educational, with an end-product of a useful professional website. I intend to find a happy medium between creating my own reusable components and leveraging the benefits of existing frameworks. Simplicity is also a primary goal, as most of my immediate projects are essentially brochure sites. Leveraging the Static Site Generation features of Next.js is very attractive for performance and low hosting overhead.
