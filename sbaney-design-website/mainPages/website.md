## Project Goals

The purpose of this project is mainly educational, with an end-product of a useful professional website. I intend to find a happy medium between creating my own reusable components and leveraging the benefits of existing frameworks. Simplicity is also a primary goal, as most of my immediate projects are essentially brochure sites. Leveraging the [Static Site Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation) features of Next.js is very attractive for performance and low hosting overhead.
