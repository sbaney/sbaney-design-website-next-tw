## Web Design

Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.

## Web Hosting

Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here.

## Technical Consulting

We'll put a happy little bush here. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing.

## Graphic Design

Get tough with it, get strong. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Don't fiddle with it all day. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Mountains are so simple, they're hard.
