# Creative

## Music

I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.

## Art

Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book.
