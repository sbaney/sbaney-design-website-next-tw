# Philosophy

Design and creativity are more about discovery than anything else. The pieces are all out there, the joy is in finding and assembling a product that is both beautiful and functional. Finding ideas and concepts that bring together the client, the end user, and the designer brings joy to the process and the user experience.

SBaney Design strives to combine the creativity of design with the structure of engineering.I focus on process as much as product, technique as much as technology, and partnership over profit.

Every business is a partnership between stakeholders, clients, and the community, and SBaney Design strives to incorporate these partnerships into all of our decisions. Open source software, proper licensing and attribution, fair pricing, privacy, human rights, and environmental considerations, among others, need to be core beliefs and not externalities.

SBaney Design is a process, and will always be a work in progress. I want our goals to be aspirational and flexible. Conversation is valued over proclamation, and constructive criticism and feedback is always welcomed. In that spirit, SBaney Design will always strive to be as transparent as reasonably possible within the constraints of client and user privacy.

There will always be tension between some of these goals, and I will not always strike the right balance, but I will always stand by my principles.

The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff that up. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. We don't want to set these clouds on fire.

It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world.

This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Just make a decision and let it go.

Brown is such a nice color. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. You have to make these big decisions.

No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.

You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. There comes a nice little fluffer. Let your imagination be your guide. We need dark in order to show light.

Let all these things just sort of happen. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Let's get wild today. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. The light is your friend. Preserve it. And just raise cain.
