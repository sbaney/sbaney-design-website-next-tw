        In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move
        mountains. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in
        your mind first. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.
        As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Maybe, just to play a
        little, we'll put a little tree here. Let all these little things
        happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let all these things just sort of happen. Maybe there's a happy little
        Evergreen that lives here. The shadows are just like the highlights, but
        we're going in the opposite direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. That's the
        way I look when I get home late; black and blue. It's a super day, so
        why not make a beautiful sky? This is where you take out all your
        hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog
        around and all that so. Get tough with it, get strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the
        framework first. This is truly an almighty mountain. You're meant to
        have fun in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Here we're limited by the time we
        have. Let the paint work. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. In
        your world you have total and absolute power.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is a
        fantastic little painting. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right
        into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap
        Green. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my
        life. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. You
        can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and
        make something beautiful out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clouds are free they come and go as they please. It's beautiful - and we
        haven't even done anything to it yet. If it's not what you want - stop
        and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.
